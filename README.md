## UI Design
For this project, we used Figma to have a mockup of the UI/UX Design.
You can access the figma template in via [this link](https://www.figma.com/proto/RrVgXYD1drzgJq9wyqXeca/GenAside?type=design&node-id=67-47&t=cllQVyJGpb1Y0vfi-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=67%3A47&mode=design).
Also we have below the sample images of the UI design that integrates elements that characterize the Palestinian country all in a minimalistic and easy to use style.
